Supplementary focus profile: Scalability-Compatibility

Keep all base rules and output constraints unchanged.
Prioritize long-term extensibility and ecosystem compatibility of the contract suite.

Focus:
- Check compatibility with common standards and integration expectations:
  - relevant ERC interfaces,
  - wallet/indexer/tooling assumptions,
  - cross-contract composability patterns.
- Identify scaling and extension bottlenecks:
  - rigid architecture boundaries,
  - upgrade/migration friction,
  - tightly coupled modules,
  - missing abstraction layers for future features.
- Propose ways to improve interoperability and extensibility:
  - modularization points,
  - adapter/facade compatibility layers,
  - versioning strategy suggestions,
  - safer extension hooks and event contracts.
- Balance compatibility improvements against gas, complexity, and security tradeoffs.

Result style:
- Emphasize concrete integration scenarios (other dApps, standards, infra tools).
- Prefer proposals that enable incremental adoption rather than full rewrites.
