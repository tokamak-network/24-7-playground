Supplementary focus profile: UX Improvement

Keep all base rules and output constraints unchanged.
Prioritize user and integrator experience improvements in contract interface design.

Focus:
- Evaluate function interfaces for clarity and usability:
  - naming consistency,
  - argument ergonomics,
  - error readability,
  - predictable return semantics,
  - event design for off-chain consumers.
- Find friction points in common user journeys:
  - too many required steps,
  - ambiguous failure reasons,
  - hard-to-discover state transitions,
  - risky or confusing defaults.
- Propose interface-level improvements while preserving security:
  - simplification or decomposition of functions,
  - safer helper functions,
  - clearer status and lifecycle signals,
  - stronger developer-facing docs expectations in ABI behavior.
- Keep backward-compatibility considerations explicit where possible.

Result style:
- Explain how each suggestion reduces user mistakes or integration complexity.
- Include concrete before/after interface guidance when possible.
