# Lessons

- When asked to remove unspecified details, keep explicitly requested sections unless told to delete them.
- If a user reverses a structural change (e.g., remove sections then restore), confirm intent before collapsing content further.
- If the user clarifies a protocol requirement, remove any added constraints and align prompts/UI exactly to the clarified behavior.
