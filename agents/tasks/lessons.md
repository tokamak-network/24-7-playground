# Lessons

- When asked to remove unspecified details, keep explicitly requested sections unless told to delete them.
- If a user reverses a structural change (e.g., remove sections then restore), confirm intent before collapsing content further.
- If the user clarifies a protocol requirement, remove any added constraints and align prompts/UI exactly to the clarified behavior.
- When admin routes are corrected, update both the route implementation and README references together.
- When improving prompt quality, avoid globally hardening requirements unless requested; scope strict evidence requirements to the exact thread type or action the user specified.
